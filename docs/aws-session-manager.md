# Setting up AWS Session Manager

## Setting up the RPi

To enable AWS Session Manager on your Raspberry Pi (Ubuntu), follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Your Pi must have outbound internet access (to reach AWS endpoints).
- You need an AWS account with permissions to create SSM Hybrid Activations.
- Know your Pi's architecture: run `uname -m` (look for `aarch64`/`arm64` for 64-bit, `armv7l`/`armhf` for 32-bit).

### 1. Update and install prerequisites
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl unzip jq
```

### 2. Install the AWS SSM Agent
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/agent-install-deb.html).

#### For ARM64 (aarch64/arm64):
```sh
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/debian_arm64/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
sudo dpkg -i amazon-ssm-agent.deb
```

#### For ARMHF (armv7l/armhf):
```sh
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/debian_armhf/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
sudo dpkg -i amazon-ssm-agent.deb
```

### 3. Enable and start the agent
```sh
sudo systemctl stop amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
```

### 4. Install AWS CLI
This is useful for diagnostics and hybrid activation, but not strictly required for the agent to run:
```sh
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-aarch64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```
> For 32-bit, see the [official AWS CLI v2 ARMv6/v7 instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

### 5. Register as a Hybrid Managed Instance (if not on EC2)
- Go to [AWS SSM Hybrid Activations](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/managed-instances/activations) and create an activation.
- On your Pi, run:
  ```sh
  sudo amazon-ssm-agent -register -code <ActivationCode> -id <ActivationId> -region <region>
  ```

### 6. Check agent status
```sh
sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent
sudo tail -n 40 /var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log
```

### Troubleshooting tips
- If the agent fails to start, check `/var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log`.
- Make sure your Pi's clock is correct (NTP), as AWS authentication is time-sensitive.
- Make sure you use the correct architecture (arm64 vs armhf) for your OS.
- The Pi must have outbound internet access to AWS SSM endpoints.

---

Once registered, your Pi will appear as a managed instance in the AWS SSM console, and you can connect to it using Session Manager from the AWS Console or AWS CLI.

> For more details, see the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/agent-install-deb.html).

## Setting up your computer

Add this to your `~/.ssh/config`:

```
# SSH over AWS Systems Manager Session Manager
host i-* mi-*
    ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    SetEnv GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Your Name" GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="your.email@example.com" GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Your Name" GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="your.email@example.com"
    SendEnv GIT_AUTHOR_NAME GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL GIT_COMMITTER_NAME GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL AWS_VAULT AWS_REGION AWS_DEFAULT_REGION AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SESSION_TOKEN AWS_CREDENTIAL_EXPIRATION
    ForwardAgent yes
```

And then connect with `ssh ubuntu@mi-XXXYYYZZZ` where `XXXYYYZZZ` is found in AWS Console.
